# Edu Genius Project

An innovative AI-driven tutoring platform designed to transform education in Pakistan by providing affordable, personalized learning for students in Grades 5-12 and university level. The platform summarizes textbooks into concise notes, offers conversational AI tutoring, and generates adaptive tests, all aligned with local curricula (e.g., Punjab Board, Aga Khan Board) and supporting Urdu/English bilingual interfaces.

Features

Note Generation: Upload textbooks or PDFs to get concise, 1-page summaries from lengthy chapters.

AI Tutor: Chat-based tutor using Socratic questioning to explain concepts and deepen understanding.

Personalized Tests: Adaptive quizzes with instant feedback and progress tracking.

Localization: Tailored for Pakistanâ€™s Matric, FSc, and O/A Level curricula with bilingual support.

Offline Mode: Cached content for low-connectivity areas, ensuring accessibility in semi-urban regions.

Accessibility: Speech-to-text for Urdu/English voice input and gamification (badges, rewards) for engagement.

Tech Stack
